When I'm feeling apathetic towards everything, I can at least find solace in drawing.

an isolated country of furry dragons where it is commonplace for women to have enormous breasts. for every 1 man, there are 4 women. men are surrounded by a woman-oriented culture.

there are many species of dragon in the country which are identified by their unique physical features. some of them are rarer than others. all are capable of interbreeding (those which aren't are considered non-draconic and may only vacation, not reside, in the country).

the only species of dragons that exceed 12' are fully aquatic. the largest species of terrestrial dragons is the _Titanodren_. the largest species of aquatic dragon is the _Colossodren_.

all species of dragons display extreme sexual dimorphism (see below comparison of isochronic female and male _Ferrodren_).
